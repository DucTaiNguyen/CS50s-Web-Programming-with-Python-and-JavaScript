# CS50s-Web-Programming-with-Python-and-JavaScript
This is the first time, I work with Django Projects. It took me 18h to do it. Although it is not a real project, I had many mistake by practice coding.
Since I understand the main dieas of the Django which is designed, It is still a lot of trouble for this time.
I learnt from this project much, I can do more to developmet it nearly.
Thank you for reading.
